# 👋 Hi, I’m Shanglin Li
- 👀 a postgraduate student at Beihang University & moonlighting as a multimodal algorithm engineer intern at Xiaohongshu Inc.
- ⭐️ I’m obsessed with shiny new tech and always up for shaking things up to make the world a tad better.
- ⏰ It’s around 11 p.m. now, and let’s be real, the only place I’ll find the PERFECT JOB at this hour is in my dreams. Sweet dreams~ 🌚
